# Portfolio Project: Study-Tool

This is the first project I built after learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is a "digital whiteboard" where the user can keep track of their studies, specifically their MCAT Kaplan review books studies.

# Motivation

When this project was built I was studying to take the MCAT by using the Kaplan review books. There are 7 core books divided into subjects: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, Behavioral Sciences, and Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills. I decided to alternate my studies between these 7 books and soon found it hard to keep track of my progress across all 7. Initailly, I kept a physical whiteboard with all the chapters of each book written out and would **change the color** of a chapter number of a certain book **if** I had finished it or was still reviewing it. Once I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript, that color changing and if condition marked boldly in the previous sentence made me think I could make my life easier if the whiteboard was built digitally.

# Decription

Built with vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

The UI is a replica of how my physical whiteboard was laid out. The user can select a a colored marker to set the color of a chapter number of a particular book. For me, green meant I was finished with the chapter, while red meant I was still reviewing it. The eraser can serve to bring back the default black color.

# Future Work

I plan on adding a percentage score to give a numeric incentive to reach 100% of chapters finished.
